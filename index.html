    <h1>Top 10 tips about plant vs zombies 2 battlez from Rafha and Timmy</h1>


    <h4>1. Hypno Shroom</h4>
    <p>In battlez it's best if you give plant food to a hypno shoom because if a zombie eats it the zombie will turn into a
        hypno gargantuar. The hypno gargantuar will destroy every zombie in it's way.
