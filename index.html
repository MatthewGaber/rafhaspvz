    <h4>1. Hypno Shroom</h4>
    <p>In battlez it's best if you give plant food to a hypno shoom because if a zombie eats it the zombie will turn into a
        hypno gargantuar. The hypno gargantuar will destroy every zombie in it's way.

    <h4>2. Plant Food</h4>

    <h4>3. Exploding Plants</h4>

    <h4>4. Lawn mowers  </h4>
    <p>In battlez you have infinity lawn mowers (the high scoring zone) but don't waste the infinity lawn mowers otherwise your 
        opponent will get more points and then you will loose.
    </p>

    <h4>5. Moon Flower  </h4>
    <p>You always use moon flower and don't forget to give them plant food, you might win the battlez.
    </p>
    <img src="./images/download.jpg" alt="download" style="width:50%;">
    <p>If you put shadow plants next to moon flower moon flower can produce 2 suns at a time.</p>
    <hr>
    
    
    <h4>6. Walnut, Tallnut and explode-o-doughnut  </h4>
    <p>explode-o-doughnut is very powerful not only that it is blocking the zombies but when the zombies eat it finished 
        it will explode killing all the zombies surrounding it but if you don't have explode-o-doughnut wall nut or tall nut is what
        you want to use.
        Tall nut cost more suns but it stops those flying zombies from getting to the high scoring zone.The wall nut cost 
        less suns and let's the flying zombies fly over it.

    <h4>7. Mints  </h4>
    <p>If you have a mint bring it because the mints can destroy so many zombies in one time and it can heal up your plants so
      the plants can have so many damage.
    </p>

    <h4>8. Powers   </h4>
    <p>In battlez you might see the little box with the powers if it has a shadow power with the up arrow that meens the game will
        heal the shadow plants but if there is cutting power with a up side down arrow that meens cutting plants are less powerful than
        usual.
